# .NET MMO Analytics

## Summary
Primarily an example of how C#'s LINQ can be leveraged to easily handle database-style problems on collections of data.  
This program simulates a Massively Multiplayer Online game which pulls in collections of players and guilds, each of which have a plethora of data associated with them.  
The controls on the Form allow you to see interesting cross-sections of the data in the log window.
